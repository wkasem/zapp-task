# Summary #

Create an application, where you can manage customers.
Save and read the data in localStorage.


# Details #

1. Create a responsive sidebar and header

2. Extend the core with an own function mycz.table.. to pass objects or arrays,
and get a responsive table back.

3. Use your new function and all the other core functions to display the table of
customers. Use mycz.ele.btn and mycz.form to allow the user to enter a new customer. Write your code therefore in your_solution.js.

4. Make the table editable.
